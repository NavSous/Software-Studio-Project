## Protocol 1 (CSV Proccessing/ Graph Reflections)

  -Load a sample data set into the dashboard, using a CSV file or other appropriate format.
  
  -Observe the initial display of the graph on the frontend of the dashboard, making note of any relevant details such as the range of the axes, the        position of data points, and the overall appearance of the graph.
  
  -Modify the underlying data set by adding, removing, or changing one or more data points.
  
  -Observe the updated display of the graph on the frontend of the dashboard, comparing it to the initial display to ensure that the changes in the underlying data are properly reflected in the graph.
  
  -Repeat steps 4 and 5 several times, using a variety of different data sets and changes, to ensure that the dashboard consistently updates the frontend graph in response to changes in the underlying data.
